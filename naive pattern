Practical 8 – Pattern Matching

# Taking input from user
text = input("Enter the text: ")
pattern = input("Enter the pattern to search: ")

# Get lengths
n = len(text)
m = len(pattern)

# Flag to check if pattern found
found = False

# Slide the pattern over text
for i in range(n - m + 1):
    j = 0
    # Check for match
    while j < m and text[i + j] == pattern[j]:
        j += 1
    if j == m:
        print("\nPattern found at positions:")
        print(f"Pattern found at index {i}")
        found = True

if not found:
    print("No pattern match found in given string.")

# Example Output:
# Enter the text: samruddhi
# Enter the pattern to search: ddh
# Pattern found at positions:
# Pattern found at index 5
